To get started with this application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```

2. Install backend dependencies:

```bash
cd server
npm install # or 'yarn install'
```

3. Install frontend dependencies:

npm install # or 'yarn install'
```

4. Set up your environment variables in a `.env` file located in the `server` directory (refer to `.env.sample` for additional information):

PLAID_PRODUCTS=
PLAID_COUNTRY_CODES=

**All user information will be stored in the specified MongoDB cluster. If you do not have a MongoDB cluster URL, you can use this app in demo mode, which will utilize mock data.**

5. Run the backend:

```bash
npm run start # or 'yarn start'
# to run in demo mode, which uses a mock database, use 'npm run start:demo' or 'yarn start:demo'
```

6. In a new terminal, start the frontend:

```

7. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
